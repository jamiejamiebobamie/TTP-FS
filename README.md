This is a repository for a stock exchange app that I built as part of a job-coding challenge. The app uses node.js, a mongodb database, and the IEX-trading API to show the valuation of a stock in real time.

The live site can be found here: https://techtalentpipeline-fullstack.herokuapp.com.

Users must submit a valid email and verify their email address before using the app.

Once verified, users can buy stocks by typing in a valid ticker symbol ('GOOG' for 'Google', 'SBUX' for 'Starbucks', etc.) and the quantity or amount of stocks the user wishes to purchase.

If you would like to contribute to this website and perhaps expand its features or improve its functionality (for example, I'm pretty sure you can buy negative stocks...), please fork the repo and download it locally.

Also if you wish to contact me regarding this app, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at: jamie.mccrory@sutdents.makeschool.com!

Thank you :).
